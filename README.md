![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=phntxx&show_icons=true&icon_color=0366d6&bg_color=ffffff&hide_title=true)

i'm a computer science student at the [university of applied sciences in regensburg](https://oth-regensburg.de) and a working student at [DRACOON](https://dracoon.com).

i like to code things with varying levels of purpose, ranging from [dashboards](https://github.com/phntxx/dashboard) to [spotify playlist analyzers](https://github.com/phntxx/playlist-analyzer).

i am also one of the system managers of [the ttp](https://thettp.org) and handle the maintenance and administration of their forum, which is a vital part of their community.

furthermore, i'm also involved with the [ratisbona coding e.v.](https://ratisbona-coding.org), where i help where possible, be it with server administration or web development.

in my spare time i like to tinker with just about anything. i write about some of those projects on [my blog](https://blog.phntxx.com).

i sometimes dj in my spare time, the fruits of which can be found on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/phntxx).
